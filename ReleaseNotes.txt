Release notes 1.1.0

- Support for GCC 6+
- Fix many errors "Tx verification failed" displayed on every transaction
- Add restricted RPC mode ("--restricted-rpc")
- Add CORS support ("--enable-cors <domains>")
- Add default fee parameter for simplewallet ("--DEFAULT_FEE")
- Add keys import and export feature for simplewallet (this now makes it possible to recover wallets converted by the GUI wallet to CLI-compatible ones)
- Fix bug in payment gate service regarding empty transaction lists
- Fix off-by-one error in daemon RPC which returned incorrect block for getblockheaderbyheight - IMPORTANT: If you had workarounds in place for this, remove them now!
- Fix security hole regarding double spend attacks with low order point key images
- Add "k_transactions_by_payment_id" RPC method
- Ensure that the RPC server is always returning data type "application/json" when returning JSON (not only at the /json_rpc endpoint) - IMPORTANT: If you were using jQuery you probably used JSON.parse there, remove it now!
- Fix incorrect spelling of "on_getblockhash" RPC command (should be "getblockhash") - old command is still accepted for compatibility reasons
- Fix incorrect spelling of "f_on_transactions_pool_json" RPC command (should be "f_transactions_pool_json")
- Change coin name to BitcoiNote - auto-create symlink for data directory so that both old and new name work (.Bitcoinote and .BitcoiNote)
- Disable start_mining/stop_mining commands in simplewallet because the daemon doesn't support them anyways
